<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I am a Lecturer (i.e., Assistant Professor) in School of Engineering at the University of Leicester, United Kingdom. </p>
<p> Previously,I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical engineering and mathematics from China Agricultural University in June 2017, my master's degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1012/2171.htm">Shouxiang Wang</a>) in Jun. 2020, and my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Aalborg University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/104410">Birgitte Bak-Jensen </a>.) in Jun.2023. From Sept. 2022 to Feb. 2023, I was an exchange student researcher at the Energy Digitalization Laboratory, The University of Hong Kong (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://www.eeyiwang.com/">Yi Wang </a>).  From Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2025, I was a postdoc researcher at Wind Engineering and Renewable Energy Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne(EPFL), mentored by Prof.  <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/fernando.porte-agel?lang=en">Fernando Porte-Agel</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, I mainly focus on the artificial intelligence in power systems, such as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and transfer learning in wind power forecasting, electricity theft detection and reactive power optimization of distribution networks.</p>
