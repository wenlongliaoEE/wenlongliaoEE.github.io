<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hi, I am a PostDoc researcher at Wind Engineering and Renewable Energy Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne(EPFL), mentored by Prof.  <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/fernando.porte-agel?lang=en">Fernando Porte-Agel</a>.</p>
<p> Previously,I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical engineering and mathematics from China Agricultural University in June 2017, my master's degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1012/2171.htm">Shouxiang Wang</a>) in Jun. 2020, and my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Aalborg University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/104410">Birgitte Bak-Jensen </a>.) in Jun.2023. From Sept. 2022 to Feb. 2023, I was an exchange student researcher at the Energy Digitalization Laboratory, The University of Hong Kongg (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://www.eeyiwang.com/">Yi Wang </a>).  </p>

<p>Currently, I mainly focus on the artificial intelligence in power systems, such as XAI and transfer learning in wind power forecasting, electricity theft detection and reactive power optimization of distribution networks.</p>
