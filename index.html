<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Hi, I am a PostDoc researcher at Wind Engineering and Renewable Energy Laboratory, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne(EPFL), mentored by Prof.  <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/fernando.porte-agel?lang=en">Fernando Porte-Agel</a>.</p>
<p> Previously,I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical engineering and mathematics from China Agricultural University in June 2017, my master's degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1012/2171.htm">Shouxiang Wang</a>) in Jun. 2020, and my Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Aalborg University (supervised by Prof.  <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/en/persons/104410">Birgitte Bak-Jensen </a>.) in Jun.2023. From Sept. 2022 to Feb. 2023, I was an exchange student researcher at the Energy Digitalization Laboratory, The University of Hong Kongg (supervised by Prof.  <a href="http://www.eeyiwang.com/">Yi Wang </a>).  </p>

<p>Currently, I mainly focus on the artificial intelligence in power systems, such as XAI and transfer learning in wind power forecasting, electricity theft detection and reactive power optimization of distribution networks.</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Nov, 2023: Our paper “Data-Driven Reactive Power Optimization of Distribution Network via Graph Attention Networks” is accpeted by Journal of Modern Power System and Clean Energy(I finished the first draft of this paper in Beijing Ditan Hospital when I got covid-19 in Feb. 2022.).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Oct, 2023 : I am excited to announce that I have been selected as a <a href="https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/postdocnet/details-and-application/"> DAAD AInet fellow </a> for the Postdoc-NeT-AI 11/2023.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Oct, 2023: Our paper “Electricity Theft Detection Using Dynamic Graph Construction and Graph Attention Network” is accpeted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics.</p>
